= Use Quarkus applications with Streams for Apache Kafka and OpenShift Service Registry

As a developer of applications and services, you can connect Quarkus applications to Kafka instances in OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka and Service Registry instances in OpenShift Service Registry. This makes it easy for development teams to store and reuse schemas in event streaming architectures.

link:https://quarkus.io[Quarkus] is a Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, and optimized for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

Quarkus is designed to work with popular Java standards, frameworks, and libraries like Eclipse MicroProfile and Spring, as well as Apache Kafka, RESTEasy (JAX-RS), Hibernate ORM (JPA), Infinispan, Camel, and many more.

In this workshop you use CodeReady Workspaces on the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift to inspect and run the Quarkus applications.

The link:https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift] provides you with a private OpenShift environment in a shared, multi-tenant OpenShift cluster that is pre-configured with a set of developer tools.

link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[CodeReady Workspaces] is an in-browser IDE that delivers consistent developer environments on Red Hat OpenShift.

[#runquarkusconsumerapp]
== Configure and run the Quarkus consumer application

In this workshop you will build and run the Quarkus application from a terminal window in CodeReady Workspaces. But before doing so, the Quarkus application needs to be configured.

To enable your Quarkus applications to access a Kafka instance, configure the connection properties using the Kafka bootstrap server endpoint. To access a Service Registry instance, configure the registry endpoint connection property with the Core Registry API value.

Access to the Service Registry and Kafka instances is managed using the same service account and SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint. For Quarkus, you can configure all connection properties using the `application.properties` file. This example sets environment variables and references them in this file.

Quarkus applications use link:https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-reactive-messaging[MicroProfile Reactive Messaging] to produce messages to and consume messages from your Kafka instances in OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka. For details on configuration options, see link:https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka[Using Apache Kafka with Reactive Messaging] in the Quarkus documentation.

. In your CodeReady Workspace, open a terminal for the `quarkus-service-registry-consumer` application. +
In the top menu, select *Terminal -> Open Terminal in specific container*.
+
image::crw-open-quarkus-terminal.png[]
+
In the popup window, select *quarkus-maven*. In the next popup, select *quarkus-service-registry-consumer* to open the terminal.
+
image::crw-open-terminal.png[]

. In the terminal window, change directory to the `consumer` directory.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
cd consumer
----
+
image::crw-terminal.png[]

. In the terminal, set the following environment variables to use your Kafka and Service Registry instances with the Quarkus application. Replace the values with your own server and credential information which you copied before from https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]:
* The <bootstrap_server> is the bootstrap server endpoint for your Kafka instance.
* The <core_registry_url> is the Core Registry API endpoint for your Service Registry instance.
* The <oauth_token_endpoint_uri> is the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint.
* The <client_id> and <client_secret> are the generated credentials for your service account.
+
Setting environment variables for server and credentials:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<bootstrap_server>
export REGISTRY_URL=<core_registry_url>
export OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URI=<oauth_token_endpoint_uri>
export CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
----

. In the Quarkus consumer source code, review the `/src/main/resources/application.properties` file in the `consumer` sub-folder to understand how the environment variables you set in the previous step are used. This example uses the `dev` configuration profile in the `application.properties` files.

. In the terminal, launch the Quarkus consumer application with the maven `quarkus:dev` goal. This will start the application in link:https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#dev-mode[Quarkus development mode].
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----

. When the application is started up, a popup appears in the bottom right corner of the IDE window, prompting to open a browser tab to the application. Click *Open In New Tab* to open the tab. 
+
image::crw-open-browser-tab.png[]
+
This opens a browser tab to the main application window of the consumer application. Once the consumer application starts to consume messages from the `quotes` topic they will appear in the browser window.

[#runquarkusproducerapp]
== Configure and run the Quarkus producer application

. In your CodeReady Workspace, open a new terminal for the `quarkus-service-registry-producer` application. +
In the top menu, select *Terminal -> Open Terminal in specific container*.
In the popup window, select *quarkus-maven*. In the next popup, select *quarkus-service-registry-producer* to open the terminal.

. In the terminal window, change directory to the `producer` directory.
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
cd producer
----

. In the terminal, set the following environment variables to use your Kafka and Service Registry instances with the Quarkus application. Replace the values with your own server and credential information which you copied before from https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]:
* The <bootstrap_server> is the bootstrap server endpoint for your Kafka instance.
* The <core_registry_url> is the Core Registry API endpoint for your Service Registry instance.
* The <oauth_token_endpoint_uri> is the SASL/OAUTHBEARER token endpoint.
* The <client_id> and <client_secret> are the generated credentials for your service account.
+
Setting environment variables for server and credentials:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
export BOOTSTRAP_SERVER=<bootstrap_server>
export REGISTRY_URL=<core_registry_url>
export OAUTH_TOKEN_ENDPOINT_URI=<oauth_token_endpoint_uri>
export CLIENT_ID=<client_id>
export CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret>
----

. In the Quarkus producer source code, review the `/src/main/resources/application.properties` file in the `producer` sub-folder to understand how the environment variables you set in the previous step are used. This example uses the `dev` configuration profile in the `application.properties` files. + 
Note the setting `mp.messaging.outgoing.quotes.apicurio.registry.auto-register=true`: this setting ensures that the Avro Schema is published to the Service Registry instance if the schema is not yet present in the instance.

. In the terminal, launch the Quarkus producer application with the maven `quarkus:dev` goal. This will start the application in link:https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling#dev-mode[Quarkus development mode].
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
mvn compile quarkus:dev
----

. When the application is started up, a popup appears in the bottom right corner of the IDE window, prompting to add a redirect to port 8081. You don't need this for this workshop, so click *no*.

. Once the producer application is started, it produces a quote messages to the `quotes` topic on your Kafka instance every five seconds. These messages are consumed by the consumer application. The quotes appear in the browser tab pointing to the `quotes.html` page of the consumer application (you might need to refresh the page to actually see the quotes).

[#inspectschema]
== Inspect the Avro schema in the Service Registry instance

The Quarkus producer application published the Avro schema corresponding to the quotes Kafka messages to the Service Registry instance, from where it is downloaded by the consumer application.

. In a browser window, navigate to your Service Registry instance in the *Application Services -> Service Registry -> Service Registry Instances* section of link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com]. Open the Service Registry instance.

. Check that the Service registry instance contains a schema corresponding to the Avro schema of the quotes Kafka messages.
+
image::service-registry-avro-schema.png[]

. Click on the schema name to inspect the metadata and the contents of the schema. Note that the schema is identical to the Avro schema in the source code of the producer application, in the `src/main/avro` directory.

[#cleanup]
== Clean up

. In the CodeReady Workspace IDE, stop the consumer and producer application by entering `Ctrl + C` in the application terminal.

. If you no longer require your instance of Service Registry and Streams for Apache Kafka, you can delete them from the *Application Services* section of link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com].
